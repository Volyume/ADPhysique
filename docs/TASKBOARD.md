# VOLYUME TASKBOARD — the single current task source

_Created 2026-07-10 by the docs staleness sweep. This is THE list the project
works from. Update it at every landing (add, move to done, re-verify).
Landed-item detail rolls to
`docs/ux-world-class-audit-2026-07-09/_HANDOVER-ARCHIVE.md` at each landing
(D41 token hygiene): this board holds only in-flight / queued / held._

## How this board works (D37 + D38 - restated)

- **D37 (staleness rule).** Nothing from a pre-campaign audit is built from its
  old blueprint. Every pre-campaign item is triaged against today's tree + the
  decision register first; superseded/reverted items are closed, not
  resurrected. All dated audit folders and loose audit/status docs now carry a
  SUPERSEDED/CLOSED banner pointing here. Work flows only from
  `docs/ux-world-class-audit-2026-07-09/_HANDOVER-AND-RESUME.md` and this board.
- **D38 (elevation rule).** A job being on a list, in an audit, or in an old
  queue is NEVER sufficient reason to build it. Before dispatch, the brief must
  state, verified against the tree: CURRENT STATE (what the app does today on
  that surface), END STATE (what the item delivers), ELEVATES BECAUSE (why the
  delta improves the app as it now is). Any item that cannot honestly carry all
  three drops to NEEDS JUSTIFICATION at the bottom of this board, not the queue.

Authority for every line below is cited inline (decision Dnn + source doc).
The full register is `docs/ux-world-class-audit-2026-07-09/DECISIONS-2026-07-09.md`.

## 1. IN FLIGHT

### CP-10 screen theming batch F (two Sonnet lanes, dispatched 2026-07-11)
- Recon (Haiku, 2026-07-11): 37/82 screens live, 45 static.
  `paywallExcerpts.js` is the HELD social-proof module, not a themable
  screen (stays dark). Batch F = the 12-screen small tail, two lanes:
- LANE F1: SettingsDietaryScreen, SettingsAccountScreen,
  SettingsFaqScreen, SettingsScreen, PrivacyPolicyScreen,
  SubscriptionPolicyScreen (billing-adjacent COPY untouched).
- LANE F2: LoginScreen (auth logic untouched), ConsistencyScreen,
  WellbeingCheckScreen (ED-SAFETY: Beat UK signposting + calm-mode
  logic and copy byte-identical, theming only, STOP on doubt),
  QuizScreen, DebugLogScreen, GoalLockConsentScreen (consent gate
  logic untouched - GDPR care).
- Same batch pattern and bounds as D/E. RECOVERY: if any of these
  files sit uncommitted, lead-review against this spec, lint + full
  suite, commit + push; if untouched, relaunch from this entry.

## 2. QUEUED (build slots - two agents at a time, lowest capable tier)

### CP-10 screen theming - remaining batches (F onward)
- **Source:** `CP-10-restart-free-theming-plan.md`; D16, D24, D29; handover THEMING COVERAGE TRACKER.
- **CURRENT STATE:** components 105/110 live; screens 37/85 live at batch E close (48 static remain); the stage-5 honesty gate (retiring the restart prompt) stays blocked until a toggle's full dependency set is live.
- **END STATE:** every screen live-themed, stage-5 cleared so restart-free theming ships fully with no stale surfaces.
- **ELEVATES BECAUSE:** the theme toggle becomes genuinely live and complete - no static islands, no restart, honest stage-5 retirement.
- **Bounds:** batch pattern as D/E; ProGate/tier logic untouched; frozen static stylesheets stay byte-identical unless converted.

### QUEUED - DECISION ROUNDS (await founder input or assets; do NOT build until resolved)
_These are open decision forks, not dispatchable builds. Their elevation is
conditional on the decision; recorded here so they are visible, not lost._

- **Watch-app scoping round.** Source: D27 (watch app SCOPING approved); `docs/ux-world-class-audit-2026-07-09/watch-app-scoping-memo.md` (5 founder questions at the end, unanswered); handover AWAITING FOUNDER. CURRENT STATE: no watch app exists; HealthKit is removed; the scoping memo is written with 5 questions open, plus a side-finding (SD-11 idempotency defect in `applyRemoteSetEvent`) flagged must-fix-before-wrist-traffic. DECISION NEEDED: founder answers the 5 questions before any build brief. ELEVATION: deferred - cannot be claimed until the scope is set.
- **Brand-font shortlist.** Source: D25 (brand variable font via expo-font approved; founder retains taste on the final typeface, lead brings a shortlist). CURRENT STATE: app uses the system font; no brand typeface adopted. DECISION NEEDED: lead presents a shortlist -> founder picks -> adopt. ELEVATION: distinctive brand typography (asset/taste-gated).

## 3. FOUNDER-SIDE OPS (not agent work - only the founder can do these)

- **iOS Live Activity provisioning.** App Groups provisioning on BOTH App IDs (`app.volyume` + `app.volyume.widget`, then EAS credentials re-sync) + fresh EAS build. The Live Activity is ALREADY fully wired in code (item 19, `60190a7` docs-only fix). Source: D27; handover item 19.
- **Fresh EAS build (device-walk gate).** Required before device-walking this branch: native modules/code landed this campaign (keyboard-controller + zeego + peers, expo-splash-screen, themed monochrome icon, D34 Kotlin rest-timer bridge, react-native-haptic-feedback). CI Android build is GREEN (run 2611, `3daa3ae`) but a signed EAS build must still be produced. Source: handover FOUNDER-SIDE ACTIONS.
- **Play OAuth SHA-1 confirm.** Source: CLAUDE.md status banner; handover.
- **Run `refresh-off-snapshot.yml`.** Lands OFF branded micronutrient data into the bundled snapshot (the operational remainder of item 16). Source: D26/D37; handover.
- **migrate_117 apply.** Telemetry-view REVOKE (drafted + committed `653fe32`); needs the exact phrase "run against production", then re-verify grants and update the file header + `supabase/README`. Source: handover AWAITING FOUNDER; CLAUDE.md supabase rules.
- **Device-walk backlog.** The fresh EAS build carries a large walk backlog: item 6 (max system font), item 13 (photo gallery), item 14 (keyboard/zeego + set-row menu), item 20 (drag reorder), weigh-in edit/delete, dietary needs, vitamins/micros, haptics, next-exercise reorder, bottom sheets, Help/FAQ, live theming, and VERIFY the timeline diary reverted to meal cards. Full step-by-step checklists are in the handover (and its archive) per item. Source: handover FOUNDER-SIDE ACTIONS + per-item checklists.

## 4. HELD / NEVER RE-PROPOSE (visible in one place - do NOT build or re-surface)

- **Exercise media programme (#18)** - HELD, founder not funding it now (D14 assessment; D29 STILL HELD). Do not re-propose.
- **Rest-day notification (#22)** - HELD (D17 FQ-1 option 3; D29 STILL HELD). Recorded gated copy/trigger for if it ever unblocks; do not build.
- **Plate calculator** - REJECTED, moot for UK users (D14 assessment). Do not re-propose.
- **Paywall social proof (review excerpts)** - NO, stays dark (D14 assessment). Do not re-propose.
- **RPE/RIR reinstatement** - settled-removed; the effort picker stays out (D14; D19 addendum re-affirmed). Do not re-surface.
- **Flat timeline food diary** - built and REVERTED on the founder's device verdict; meal cards are canonical. NEVER re-propose (D37 item 15).
- **Supabase migrations 049 / 059** - HELD (CLAUDE.md status; `supabase/README`). Do not apply.
- **AI-assisted food input (photo meal-scan / voice)** - HELD by founder order, not rejected and not approved; do not build or re-propose unprompted (D27 addendum). (The coaching engine's no-AI rule is separate and absolute.)

## 5. NEEDS JUSTIFICATION - do not dispatch (D38: missing a verifiable field)

### Kala namak micro-call
- **Source:** handover resume point (2, NEXT SLOTS) names it as a remaining delegated micro-decision, "verify-first"; it relates to the dietary Phase B curated-meal work (D8/dietary rulings).
- **WHY PARKED:** the CURRENT STATE of this micro-decision cannot be honestly verified from the docs reviewed in this sweep (no kala-namak detail found in the ux-world-class-audit folder). Its end state and elevation therefore cannot be articulated. Needs the lead's dietary Phase B context to state current -> end -> elevation before it can enter the queue or be dispatched.

## Appendix - folded-in / reference-only sources (not build queues)

- Landed-item history: `docs/ux-world-class-audit-2026-07-09/_HANDOVER-ARCHIVE.md`
  (TASKBOARD HISTORY section) + the handover stage log.
- `docs/exercise-planning-2026-07-09/` (plans A-G): all SHIPPED; retained as
  design reference only. Do not rebuild. Residual engine changes go through the
  register + D37/D38 triage.
- `docs/design-usability-audit-2026-07-09/`: D7 programme complete; only
  `coverage-00-SYNTHESIS.md` survives as a cited reference. Residual IDs are
  tracked in the live campaign, not re-mined from that folder.
