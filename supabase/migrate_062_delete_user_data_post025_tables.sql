-- Migration 062: extend delete_user_data to the tables added since migration 025
--
-- HP-3. The account-delete Edge Function removes the auth.users row and the
-- ON DELETE CASCADE FKs wipe every user-scoped table, so the primary path is
-- complete. The client falls back to the delete_user_data RPC when the Edge
-- Function is missing or un-deployed, and that RPC was last made complete in
-- migration 025. Five user-scoped tables created since then are not wiped by
-- the fallback, so a deletion that goes down the fallback path leaves their
-- rows behind (an erasure gap):
--
--   tier_history            (migration 030)
--   notification_preferences (migration 044)
--   food_frequents          (migration 051)
--   device_push_tokens      (migration 053)
--   daily_steps             (migration 056)
--
-- account_deletions_log (migration 039) is deliberately NOT wiped: it is the
-- non-cascading audit trail that records the deletion itself and must survive
-- it (PRIVACY_CONSENT_LOCKED.md, and engine_telemetry's catalogue note).
--
-- This re-creates delete_user_data with the migration 025 body verbatim plus
-- a new section for the five tables. Every delete stays wrapped in EXCEPTION
-- WHEN undefined_table so a table that doesn't exist in a given project does
-- not abort the rest of the RPC.
--
-- Applied locally:  NO (pending)
-- Applied remotely: NO (pending founder apply)
-- Safe to re-run:   YES. CREATE OR REPLACE; the body is idempotent (deleting
--                   already-absent rows is a no-op).
-- Rollback:         re-apply migration 025 to drop the five extra deletes.
-- App dependency:   none. Identical signature (delete_user_data() -> void);
--                   old app builds and the frozen AAB keep working and now
--                   wipe more on the fallback path.
